| In this lesson, we'll see how to extract elements from a vector based on some
| conditions that we specify.

...

| For example, we may only be interested in the first 20 elements of a vector, or
| only the elements that are not NA, or only those that are positive or correspond
| to a specific variable of interest. By the end of this lesson, you'll know how
| to handle each of these scenarios.

| I've created for you a vector called x that contains a random ordering of 20
| numbers (from a standard normal distribution) and 20 NAs. Type x now to see what
| it looks like.

| The way you tell R that you want to select some particular elements (i.e. a
| 'subset') from a vector is by placing an 'index vector' in square brackets
| immediately following the name of the vector.

...

  |=======                                                                  |  10%
| For a simple example, try x[1:10] to view the first ten elements of x.

 [8] -0.4718115  0.5264010  0.7660555

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |=========                                                                |  13%
| Index vectors come in four different flavors -- logical vectors, vectors of
| positive integers, vectors of negative integers, and vectors of character
| strings -- each of which we'll cover in this lesson.

...

  |===========                                                              |  15%
| Let's start by indexing with logical vectors. One common scenario when working
| with real-world data is that we want to extract all elements of a vector that
| are not NA (i.e. missing data). Recall that is.na(x) yields a vector of logical
| values the same length as x, with TRUEs corresponding to NA values in x and
| FALSEs corresponding to non-NA values in x.

...

  |=============                                                            |  18%
| What do you think x[is.na(x)] will give you?

1: A vector with no NAs
2: A vector of all NAs
3: A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
4: A vector of length 0

Selection: 1

| Not exactly. Give it another go.

| Remember that is.na(x) tells us where the NAs are in a vector. So if we subset x
| based on that, what do you expect to happen?

1: A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
2: A vector with no NAs
3: A vector of all NAs
4: A vector of length 0

Selection: 3

| All that practice is paying off!

  |===============                                                          |  21%
| Prove it to yourself by typing x[is.na(x)].

> x[is.na(x)]
 [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

| You are really on a roll!

  |=================                                                        |  23%
| Recall that `!` gives us the negation of a logical expression, so !is.na(x) can
| be read as 'is not NA'. Therefore, if we want to create a vector called y that
| contains all of the non-NA values from x, we can use y <- x[!is.na(x)]. Give it
| a try.

> y <- x[!is.na(x)]

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |===================                                                      |  26%
| Print y to the console.

| Excellent work!

| Now that we've isolated the non-missing values of x and put them in y, we can
| subset y as we please.

...

  |======================                                                   |  31%
| Recall that the expression y > 0 will give us a vector of logical values the
| same length as y, with TRUEs corresponding to values of y that are greater than
| zero and FALSEs corresponding to values of y that are less than or equal to
| zero. What do you think y[y > 0] will give you?

1: A vector of all the negative elements of y
2: A vector of all the positive elements of y
3: A vector of all NAs
4: A vector of length 0
5: A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |========================                                                 |  33%
| Type y[y > 0] to see that we get all of the positive elements of y, which are
| also the positive elements of our original vector x.

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |==========================                                               |  36%
| You might wonder why we didn't just start with x[x > 0] to isolate the positive
| elements of x. Try that now to see why.

> x[x>0]

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |============================                                             |  38%
| Since NA is not a value, but rather a placeholder for an unknown quantity, the
| expression NA > 0 evaluates to NA. Hence we get a bunch of NAs mixed in with our
| positive numbers when we do this.

...

  |==============================                                           |  41%
| Combining our knowledge of logical operators with our new knowledge of
| subsetting, we could do this -- x[!is.na(x) & x > 0]. Try it out.

> x[!is.na(x) & x > 0]
 [1] 0.397396662 0.526401016 0.766055455 1.275291217 0.312647551 2.504399560
 [7] 0.743280804 1.307977744 0.504091928 0.005914314

| You are doing so well!

  |================================                                         |  44%
| In this case, we request only values of x that are both non-missing AND greater
| than zero.

...

  |==================================                                       |  46%
| I've already shown you how to subset just the first ten values of x using
| x[1:10]. In this case, we're providing a vector of positive integers inside of
| the square brackets, which tells R to return only the elements of x numbered 1
| through 10.

...

  |====================================                                     |  49%
| Many programming languages use what's called 'zero-based indexing', which means
| that the first element of a vector is considered element 0. R uses 'one-based
| indexing', which (you guessed it!) means the first element of a vector is
| considered element 1.

...

  |=====================================                                    |  51%
| Can you figure out how we'd subset the 3rd, 5th, and 7th elements of x? Hint --
| Use the c() function to specify the element numbers as a numeric vector.

> x[c(3,5,7)]
[1]        NA 0.3973967        NA

| You are really on a roll!

  |=======================================                                  |  54%
| It's important that when using integer vectors to subset our vector x, we stick
| with the set of indexes {1, 2, ..., 40} since x only has 40 elements. What
| happens if we ask for the zeroth element of x (i.e. x[0])? Give it a try.

> x[41]
[1] NA

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Try x[0] to see what happens when we refer to the zeroth element of a vector,
| which is not defined in R.

> x[0]
numeric(0)

| Excellent work!

  |=========================================                                |  56%
| As you might expect, we get nothing useful. Unfortunately, R doesn't prevent us
| from doing this. What if we ask for the 3000th element of x? Try it out.

> x[3000]
[1] NA

| All that practice is paying off!

  |===========================================                              |  59%
| Again, nothing useful, but R doesn't prevent us from asking for it. This should
| be a cautionary tale. You should always make sure that what you are asking for
| is within the bounds of the vector you're working with.

...

  |=============================================                            |  62%
| What if we're interested in all elements of x EXCEPT the 2nd and 10th? It would
| be pretty tedious to construct a vector containing all numbers 1 through 40
| EXCEPT 2 and 10.

...

  |===============================================                          |  64%
| Luckily, R accepts negative integer indexes. Whereas x[c(2, 10)] gives us ONLY
| the 2nd and 10th elements of x, x[c(-2, -10)] gives us all elements of x EXCEPT
| for the 2nd and 10 elements.  Try x[c(-2, -10)] now to see this.

> x[c(-2,-10)]
 [1]           NA           NA           NA  0.397396662 -0.282005272           NA

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |=================================================                        |  67%
| A shorthand way of specifying multiple negative numbers is to put the negative

| You got it!

  |===================================================                      |  69%
| So far, we've covered three types of index vectors -- logical, positive integer,
| and negative integer. The only remaining type requires us to introduce the
| concept of 'named' elements.

...

  |====================================================                     |  72%
| Create a numeric vector with three named elements using vect <- c(foo = 11, bar
| = 2, norf = NA).

> vect <- c(foo = 11, bar
+           | = 2, norf = NA)
Error: unexpected '=' in:
"vect <- c(foo = 11, bar
          | ="
> vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA)

| All that practice is paying off!

  |======================================================                   |  74%
| When we print vect to the console, you'll see that each element has a name. Try
| it out.

> vect
 foo  bar norf 
  11    2   NA 

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |========================================================                 |  77%
| We can also get the names of vect by passing vect as an argument to the names()
| function. Give that a try.

> names(vect)
[1] "foo"  "bar"  "norf"

| That's a job well done!

  |==========================================================               |  79%
| Alternatively, we can create an unnamed vector vect2 with c(11, 2, NA). Do that
| now.

> vect2 <- c(11, 2, NA)

| You got it right!

  |============================================================             |  82%
| Then, we can add the `names` attribute to vect2 after the fact with names(vect2)
| <- c("foo", "bar", "norf"). Go ahead.

> names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")

| You got it right!

  |==============================================================           |  85%
| Now, let's check that vect and vect2 are the same by passing them as arguments
| to the identical() function.

> identical(vect, vect2)
[1] TRUE

| You're the best!

  |================================================================         |  87%
| Indeed, vect and vect2 are identical named vectors.

...

  |==================================================================       |  90%
| Now, back to the matter of subsetting a vector by named elements. Which of the
| following commands do you think would give us the second element of vect?

1: vect["bar"]
2: vect["2"]
3: vect[bar]

Selection: 3

| Keep trying!

| In this lesson, we'll cover matrices and data frames. Both represent
| 'rectangular' data types, meaning that they are used to store tabular data, with
| rows and columns.

...

  |==                                                                       |   3%
| The main difference, as you'll see, is that matrices can only contain a single
| class of data, while data frames can consist of many different classes of data.

...

  |====                                                                     |   6%
| Let's create a vector containing the numbers 1 through 20 using the `:`
| operator. Store the result in a variable called my_vector.

> my_vector<-c(1:20)

| That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| You learned about the `:` operator in the lesson on sequences. If you wanted to
| create a vector containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3 (in that order), you could
| use either c(1, 2, 3) or 1:3. In this case, we want the numbers 1 through 20
| stored in a variable called my_vector. Also, remember that you don't need the
| c() function when using `:`.

> my_vector<-1:20

| Keep up the great work!

  |======                                                                   |   8%

| You are doing so well!

  |========                                                                 |  11%
| The dim() function tells us the 'dimensions' of an object. What happens if we do
| dim(my_vector)? Give it a try.

> dim
function (x)  .Primitive("dim")

| Nice try, but that's not exactly what I was hoping for. Try again. Or, type
| info() for more options.

| Just type dim(my_vector) to see what happens.

> 
> dim(my_vector)
NULL

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |==========                                                               |  14%
| Clearly, that's not very helpful! Since my_vector is a vector, it doesn't have a
| `dim` attribute (so it's just NULL), but we can find its length using the
| length() function. Try that now.

> length(my_vector)
[1] 20

| You are quite good my friend!

  |============                                                             |  17%
| Ah! That's what we wanted. But, what happens if we give my_vector a `dim`
| attribute? Let's give it a try. Type dim(my_vector) <- c(4, 5).

> dim(my_vector) <- c(4,5)

| All that practice is paying off!

  |==============                                                           |  19%
| It's okay if that last command seemed a little strange to you. It should! The
| dim() function allows you to get OR set the `dim` attribute for an R object. In
| this case, we assigned the value c(4, 5) to the `dim` attribute of my_vector.

...

  |================                                                         |  22%
| Use dim(my_vector) to confirm that we've set the `dim` attribute correctly.

> dim(my_vector)
[1] 4 5

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |==================                                                       |  25%
| Another way to see this is by calling the attributes() function on my_vector.
| Try it now.

> attributes(my_vector)
$dim
[1] 4 5


| You got it right!

  |====================                                                     |  28%
| Just like in math class, when dealing with a 2-dimensional object (think
| rectangular table), the first number is the number of rows and the second is the
| number of columns. Therefore, we just gave my_vector 4 rows and 5 columns.

...

  |======================                                                   |  31%
| But, wait! That doesn't sound like a vector any more. Well, it's not. Now it's a
| matrix. View the contents of my_vector now to see what it looks like.

> my_vector
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    5    9   13   17
[2,]    2    6   10   14   18
[3,]    3    7   11   15   19
[4,]    4    8   12   16   20

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |========================                                                 |  33%
| Now, let's confirm it's actually a matrix by using the class() function. Type
| class(my_vector) to see what I mean.

> class(my_vector)
[1] "matrix" "array" 

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==========================                                               |  36%
| Sure enough, my_vector is now a matrix. We should store it in a new variable
| that helps us remember what it is. Store the value of my_vector in a new
| variable called my_matrix.

> my_matrix <- my_vector

| You got it right!

  |============================                                             |  39%
| The example that we've used so far was meant to illustrate the point that a
| matrix is simply an atomic vector with a dimension attribute. A more direct
| method of creating the same matrix uses the matrix() function.

...

  |==============================                                           |  42%
| Bring up the help file for the matrix() function now using the `?` function.

> ?matrix

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |================================                                         |  44%
| Now, look at the documentation for the matrix function and see if you can figure
| out how to create a matrix containing the same numbers (1-20) and dimensions (4
| rows, 5 columns) by calling the matrix() function. Store the result in a
| variable called my_matrix2.

> matrix(data = 1:20, nrow = 4, ncol = 5)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    5    9   13   17
[2,]    2    6   10   14   18
[3,]    3    7   11   15   19
[4,]    4    8   12   16   20

| Not quite right, but keep trying. Or, type info() for more options.

| Call the matrix() function with three arguments -- 1:20, the number of rows, and
| the number of columns. Be sure to specify arguments by their proper names and
| store the result in my_matrix2 (not in my_matrix).

> my_matrix2 <- matrix(data = 1:20, nrow = 4, ncol = 5)

| All that practice is paying off!

  |==================================                                       |  47%
| Finally, let's confirm that my_matrix and my_matrix2 are actually identical. The
| identical() function will tell us if its first two arguments are the same. Try
| it out.

> identical(my_matrix, my_matrix2)
[1] TRUE

| Nice work!

  |====================================                                     |  50%
| Now, imagine that the numbers in our table represent some measurements from a
| clinical experiment, where each row represents one patient and each column
| represents one variable for which measurements were taken.

...

  |=======================================                                  |  53%
| We may want to label the rows, so that we know which numbers belong to each
| patient in the experiment. One way to do this is to add a column to the matrix,
| which contains the names of all four people.

...

  |=========================================                                |  56%
| Let's start by creating a character vector containing the names of our patients
| -- Bill, Gina, Kelly, and Sean. Remember that double quotes tell R that
| something is a character string. Store the result in a variable called patients.

> patients <- c("Bill", "Gina", "Kelly", "Sean")

| You're the best!

  |===========================================                              |  58%
| Now we'll use the cbind() function to 'combine columns'. Don't worry about
| storing the result in a new variable. Just call cbind() with two arguments --
| the patients vector and my_matrix.

> cbind(patients, my_matrix)
     patients                       
[1,] "Bill"   "1" "5" "9"  "13" "17"
[2,] "Gina"   "2" "6" "10" "14" "18"
[3,] "Kelly"  "3" "7" "11" "15" "19"
[4,] "Sean"   "4" "8" "12" "16" "20"

| That's correct!

  |=============================================                            |  61%
| Something is fishy about our result! It appears that combining the character
| vector with our matrix of numbers caused everything to be enclosed in double
| quotes. This means we're left with a matrix of character strings, which is no
| good.

...

  |===============================================                          |  64%
| If you remember back to the beginning of this lesson, I told you that matrices
| can only contain ONE class of data. Therefore, when we tried to combine a
| character vector with a numeric matrix, R was forced to 'coerce' the numbers to
| characters, hence the double quotes.

...

  |=================================================                        |  67%
| This is called 'implicit coercion', because we didn't ask for it. It just
| happened. But why didn't R just convert the names of our patients to numbers?
| I'll let you ponder that question on your own.

...

  |===================================================                      |  69%
| So, we're still left with the question of how to include the names of our
| patients in the table without destroying the integrity of our numeric data. Try
| the following -- my_data <- data.frame(patients, my_matrix)

> my_data <- data.frame(patients, my_matrix)

| You are doing so well!

  |=====================================================                    |  72%
| Now view the contents of my_data to see what we've come up with.

> my_data
  patients X1 X2 X3 X4 X5
1     Bill  1  5  9 13 17
2     Gina  2  6 10 14 18
3    Kelly  3  7 11 15 19
4     Sean  4  8 12 16 20

| Keep up the great work!

  |=======================================================                  |  75%
| It looks like the data.frame() function allowed us to store our character vector
| of names right alongside our matrix of numbers. That's exactly what we were
| hoping for!

...

  |=========================================================                |  78%
| Behind the scenes, the data.frame() function takes any number of arguments and
| returns a single object of class `data.frame` that is composed of the original
| objects.

...

  |===========================================================              |  81%
| Let's confirm this by calling the class() function on our newly created data
| frame.

> class(my_data)
[1] "data.frame"

| Great job!

  |=============================================================            |  83%
| It's also possible to assign names to the individual rows and columns of a data
| frame, which presents another possible way of determining which row of values in
| our table belongs to each patient.

...

  |===============================================================          |  86%
| However, since we've already solved that problem, let's solve a different
| problem by assigning names to the columns of our data frame so that we know what
| type of measurement each column represents.

...

  |=================================================================        |  89%
| Since we have six columns (including patient names), we'll need to first create
| a vector containing one element for each column. Create a character vector
| called cnames that contains the following values (in order) -- "patient", "age",
| "weight", "bp", "rating", "test".

> cnames <- c("patient", "age",
+             | "weight", "bp", "rating", "test")
Error: unexpected '|' in:
"cnames <- c("patient", "age",
            |"
> cnames <- c("patient", "age", "weight", "bp", "rating", "test")

| You are really on a roll!

  |===================================================================      |  92%
| Now, use the colnames() function to set the `colnames` attribute for our data
| frame. This is similar to the way we used the dim() function earlier in this
| lesson.

> colnames(my_data) <- cnames

| Excellent work!

  |=====================================================================    |  94%
| Let's see if that got the job done. Print the contents of my_data.

> my_data
  patient age weight bp rating test
1    Bill   1      5  9     13   17
2    Gina   2      6 10     14   18
3   Kelly   3      7 11     15   19
4    Sean   4      8 12     16   20

| You're the best!

  |=======================================================================  |  97%
| In this lesson, you learned the basics of working with two very important and
| common data structures -- matrices and data frames. There's much more to learn
| and we'll be covering more advanced topics, particularly with respect to data
